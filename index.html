                Uncooked dumplings can be placed in a single layer on a tray lined with parchment paper, and frozen for later. Once the dumplings are frozen, you can transfer them to a zip-top bag or freezer-safe container, and use within 3 months. To cook, defrost the dumplings and then cook using the regular instructions.
                Cooked dumplings can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days. Reheat in the skillet to re-crisp or they will be a bit soggy.

            <p>Many ideas have emerged about when and where Italian spaghetti was invented. In 1154, Roger II proclaimed Abu Abdullah Mohammad al-Adris, a geographer and historian, to visit Sicily and Spain . He traveled to areas such as Pabamo to study. He published a book about his adventures, The Book of Roger, in which he wrote about Italian noodles. In Trabia, Sicily, large quantities of Italian wheat noodles were invented and shipped to other regions. Small noodles were also invented and eaten. In the early days of Italian noodles, meat and spices were added to make them more palatable, and only the upper classes were eaten.

                <h3>Step 1: Get Your Supplies</h3>
                <img src="img/image/1.jpeg" class="allsize">
                <p class="parafit">
                    Before you can start making your spaghetti you will need to first get the proper supplies and materials. To make this spaghetti you will need are: a box of spaghettia jar of marinara sauce, 1-2 pounds of ground beef or Italian sausage, two large pots,
                    one for boiling the pasta and the other for making the sauceserving untensils, salt and water. You can use as much meat as you want, really - but anywhere from 1-2 pounds per large jar of sauce should work out best. I tend to use 1
                    pound of meat nearly every time.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="one">
                <h3>Step 2: Cooking the Meat + Get the Water Boiling</h3>
                <img src="img/image/2.jpeg" class="allsize">
                <p class="parafit">Before you start, fill up a large pot with water and add a handful of salt. Put it on the stove and turn it to high so it'll start boiling! Next you will need to cook the of meat. Take all of the meat out of its container and set it all
                    in a large pan, then put the pan on the stove and set the stove to medium.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3: Mixing in the Sauce</h3>
                <img src="img/image/3.jpeg" class="allsize">
                <p class="parafit">
                    Next you will need to mix your marinara sauce with your cooked meat. Take your jar of marinara sauce and pour all of it on the cooked meat and then stir it all around until it is all blended together. Then turn the heat down to low and let it simmer while
                    you cook the pasta.

                <h3>Step 4: Cooking the Spaghetti</h3>
                <img src="img/image/4.jpeg" class="allsize">
                <p class="parafit">
                    Once the water has come up to a boil, you can throw the spaghetti in. Typically it should cook within 7-11 minutes - just follow the time on the box!<br>Make sure to stir every couple minutes to keep it from sticking.<br> Depending
                    on your timing, you can either strain the spaghetti and set it aside, or you can put it right into the sauce.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 5: Serving Your Spaghetti</h3>
                <img src="img/image/5.jpeg" class="allsize">
                <p class="parafit">You can do this in a lot of ways but I prefer mixing the noodles in the pan with the sauce. I use tongs to drain the noodles and place them in the sauce, and then put in a couple spoons of pasta water. Stir it all together really well
                    - the pasta water coats all the noodles and lets the sauce stick more. You can also put plain spaghetti on individual plates and spoon the sauce over top. Whatever works for you.</p>
